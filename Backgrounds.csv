Despite the nauseous feelings it provokes in other nations, slavery remains a publicly popular option for insolvent Imperial citizens.  Victims of legal cases, poor students, and rash entrepreneurs all benefit from a system that removes all debt and prevents them from being executed by the internal security force. Being a slave soldier for the Empire is actually a rather lucky placement.  Few people want to mess with the Imperial navy, so it is safer than it seems.  However you have to be quite wily; a slave gets the worst equipment, quarters, and rations of any serving soldier in the navy.'),\
